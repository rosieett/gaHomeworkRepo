# Homework directory

These are the instructions for starting and submitting your homework.

## Instructions
1. `git clone` this repo if you have not already.
2. `git pull origin master` to make sure you have the latest from the remote repo.
3. `git checkout -b add-hw2-your-name`, to create a new feature branch and check it out. Replace `2` with the actual homework number.
4. Navigate to this folder in your local repo.
5. Make a copy of the folder containing the starter files and name the folder `1-your-name`. Replace `1` with the actual homework number. This can be done on the command line from this directory with `cp jsonChallenge.js 2-your-name.js`, replacing `your-name` with your actual name and `2` with the actual homework number. If there are no starter files, simply create a directory following the previously mentioned scheme `2-your-name` and put your project files there.
6. Navigate to the directory with the copy of the starter files you just created.
7. Make your changes. Get things working. Experiment!
8. `git add -A` to stage changes.
9. `git commit -m 'meaningful commit message'` to commit your changes.
10. `git push` to push your changes to the remote repository and to your feature branch.
11. After push, you'll see a message in your terminal with a link to open a pull request. Open the pull request. Alternatively, if for some reason you do not see this, you can simply visit https://git.generalassemb.ly/sdotson/JSD-course-materials in your web browser and you should see an option to open a pull request.
12. Celebrate!
